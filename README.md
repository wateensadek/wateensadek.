__Neuroscience🧠__

__*3rd year*__

I enrolled in this course because I have always been curious about coding in neuroscience and wanted to try something new :) 

The research aspect of neuroscience and learning about different mental health disorders and how it affects an individual is what got me interested in neuroscience.

Medicine or a masters in biomedical engineering👩‍🎓
